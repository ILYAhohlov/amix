      "Welcome to the Van Don Economic Zone (VDEZ), a rising star in Quang Ninh Province, Vietnam, poised to become a premier investment hub in Southeast Asia.",
      "Nestled among over 600 stunning islands and near the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Ha Long Bay, Van Don blends natural beauty with ambitious plans to transform into a multi-sector marine economic zone by 2040.",
      "<strong>Why Van Don is the Perfect Investment Destination</strong>",
      "Van Don Economic Zone is more than breathtaking landscapes—it’s a strategic hub offering unparalleled benefits for investors:",
      "<ul><li><strong>Booming Tourism Market</strong>: In June 2025, Vietnam’s government approved a $2 billion high-end tourism complex, featuring a casino, luxury hotels, convention centers, and villas. This project is expected to attract up to 2.4 million visitors annually, driving demand for related services and real estate. Vietnam’s tourism sector is already thriving, with a 30% increase in foreign visitors in 2025, reaching 10.7 million in the first half of the year.</li></ul>",
      "<ul><li><strong>Generous Tax Incentives</strong>: VDEZ offers exceptional benefits, including a 10% Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rate for 15 years, a full tax exemption for 4 years, and a 50% reduction for the next 9 years—making it one of the most business-friendly zones in ASEAN.</li></ul>",
      "<ul><li><strong>Strategic Location</strong>: With Van Don International Airport (handling 2.6 million passengers annually) and the Van Don–Mong Cai Expressway, the zone is just a two-hour flight from key markets like China and Hong Kong.</li></ul>",
      "<ul><li><strong>Diverse Opportunities</strong>: From boutique hotels and eco-resorts to IT parks and logistics hubs, Van Don opens doors to investments in tourism, real estate, technology, and infrastructure.</li></ul>",
      "<strong>What Can You Invest in Van Don?</strong>",
      "While major contractors for the $2 billion project are likely set, Van Don remains open to fresh ideas and capital. Here are some promising investment avenues:",
      "<ul><li><strong>Tourism and Hospitality</strong>: Invest in eco-lodges, yacht tours, or cultural centers to cater to the growing tourist influx. For example, a boutique hotel on Quan Lan Island could yield steady returns due to its proximity to Bai Tu Long Bay.</li></ul>",
      "<ul><li><strong>Real Estate</strong>: Demand for housing for staff and expatriates is rising. Residential complexes or shopping centers near the tourism complex offer opportunities for investments ranging from $5 to $50 million.</li></ul>",
      "<ul><li><strong>High-Tech and Innovation</strong>: VDEZ supports startups in AI, semiconductors, and green technologies. Investments in an IT park or waste recycling facility can be scalable and profitable.</li></ul>",
      "<ul><li><strong>Logistics</strong>: The airport and expressway create demand for warehouses and transport services. Investing in a logistics center or digital transport platform is a forward-looking move.</li></ul>",
      "Each of these sectors is backed by tax incentives and Vietnam’s growing economy, minimizing risks and boosting returns.",
